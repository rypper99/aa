    <h1>My Era Tour Movie Review</h1>

    <p>I saw it again last Friday with Wade and Nadine at their house 
    It was very good the second time around 
    My Favourite Eraâ€™s in the movie were and still are :
    
    <ul>
    <li>Lover</li>
    <li>Folklore</li> 
    <li>Evermore </li>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li>Midnights</li> 
    <li>Fearless</li> 
    <li>1989</li> 
    <li>Speak Now</li> 
    <li>Reputation</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    In that certain order 
    I very like the trees for Evermore and Folklore 
    I also very like the Cabin for Folk lore 
    I also very like the moss piano for Evermore 
    I also very like the flower tapestries for Lover 
    And the purple clouds for lavender haze for Midnights as well
    Me and Nadine were singing along to all the songs
    My only complaint with this movie . That other swifties found out as well online will and do agree with me on this :
    Whoever make this for homes
    They put the 3 extra songs at the very end . Right after Karma 
    Not where they belong in the show like  at all 
    The archer is not in her lover set 
    Wildest Dreams is not in her 1989 set 
    Long Live is not in her Speak Now Set 
    Otherwise pretty good 
    Exactly like how I see it in the theatres with them both 
    Besides the 3 extra songs 
    So with that complaint in mind 
    I give this movie a solid 9 and a half out of 10 stars 
    If they actually put the songs where they belong
    I will then give this movie a 10 out of 10 stars
