    <h1>My Fourth Wing Book Review</h1>

    <p>I had finished The Fourth Wing
    <p>Which Grandma May brought for me for my birthday 
    <p>This book is all about a girl who wants to be in the scribes quadrant . Named Violet . Which is a lot like Raven Claw . From Harry Potter but she was put in by her mother into the Riders Quadrant . Which is a lot like Gryffindoor but they ride dragons . That’s why they are called The Riders Quadrant 
    <p>Which is the most dangerous and violent quadrant . Where you either survive and bond with a dragon or die 
    <p>She bonded with 2 dragons . Nobody had bonded with 2 dragons before her 
    <p>It have quite a lot of swear words in the book 
    <p>But I don’t say them . Instead I just say “ bad word “ instead 
    <p>I also very appreciated it give me a warning about what’s gonna happen in the book because I am pretty sensitive right before I actually read it
    <p>So that’s very good then 
    <p>They is a enemy to lovers thing going on in that book 
    <p>At first Violet did very like Xaden that much because he did want to kill her 
    <p>But later on In the book he did not want to kill her because others want to kill her 
    <p>Also later on in the book Violet starts to kind of like Xaden but way later in the book . She declared her love to Xaden . 
    <p>Also Xaden at the end of the book . Declared his love to Violet 
    <p>Now I have the second book in the series . The iron flame 
    <p>Which Grandma Norma brought for me as my belated birthday gift 
    <p>Which she did FaceTime me with mom to see me open my belated birthday gift
    <p>I was so shocked and surprised about the gift
    <p>But it was a very good shock and surprise as well 
    <p>I had looked at it at Costco a few days ago 
    <p>But now still I have it 
    <p>You were very like this book . If you like fantasy and dragons . Also strong , smart , female heroines as well . Also you will like this book if you like the hunger games but if it was fantasy instead of dystopian 
    <p>Because just like the hunger games . The fourth wing is all about survival but with dragons 
    <p>Not a game where you kill other people to win 
    <p>Violet did not think she will survive the rider quadrant and bond with a dragon but she did survived but bond with not just one dragon but 2 dragons 
    <p>Also she did think she will get any powers from her dragons 
    <p>But she did get a power to make lightning and thunder 
    <p>She said in her own words to Xaden “ Everybody else’s powers are helpful but me and my power are not helpful . I am a monster because of my power . I killed somebody with my power . “
    <p>What he said to her in his own words “ you are not a monster . So you have the power to control lightning and thunder . Just need to control that power and aim where you want to . So then you won’t hurt anybody in the process “
    <p>I give this book a solid 9 and a half stars out of 10
    <p>If there won’t a lot of swear words . I probably then give this book a 10 out of 10 stars .
    <p>But because of all the swearing .
    <p>That’s how I will have to rate this book as 
    <p>This book is not for younger kids Under the age of 15 
    <p>Because of the violence , swearing and sex believe it or not 
    <p>Yes you heard that right . This book have sex in it 
    <p>Most of the ya books I read in the past  . Don’t go as far as sex . Mostly  kissing and some hand holding maybe but that’s all . Which is pretty tame compared to this book . The 2 main characters have sex 
    <p>13 year olds are not ready for books with Sex in it 
    <p>Even though they are teenagers 
    <p>But 15 year olds were be fine with sex in this book though 
    <p>Such they are a bit older and understand what sex is compared to 13 year olds 
    <p>So this book and the second book are for more older teenagers and young adults because of the sex , swearing and violence 
    <p>Also most ya books I did read in the past . Don’t have a lot of swearing either 
    <p>Maybe a little , tiny bit but not much swearing at all 
    <p>Also most ya books I had read in the past .  The main characters are younger than I am . Like mostly 16 or 17 year olds 
    <p>Not 20 year olds or in their 20’s
    <p>But in this book and the second book  all the main characters including the female protagonist Violet are 20 or above 
    <p>Which is very great 
    <p>Because I am not 16 or 17 in high school anymore  . 
    <p>Not anymore 
    <p>So I do need the main character / female protagonist to be closer to my very , own age . Which is 25 yrs old . Not 16 or 17 yrs old .
    <p>More like 20 yrs old or in their 20’s just like me .
    <p>That means they are more relatable to me than somebody still in high school and younger 
    <p>If they are 16 or 17 . I can’t very relate to them that much 
    <p>But if they are older than 17 .
    <p>Like 18 or 20 yrs old
    <p>I can relate to them better 
    <p>Way better
    <p>Which is very , very , very good indeed then
    <p>Super , duper good indeed then
