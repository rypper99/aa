    <h1>My A COURT of THORNES and ROSES</h1>

    <p>
      
It’s pretty much a beauty and a beast retelling 

Based off the plot 

A human girl gets stuck in a castle with a beast . But not always a beast . Sometimes a handsome high lord . Which is like a prince but lord instead of the word prince .Only sometimes he’s a beast aka a wolf 

Expect there’s no curse not very or enchanted objects in his palace aka castle 

Instead he have an Assistant.

The beast’s name Is Tamlin.

The girl aka beauty’s name is Feyre . 

Unlike Belle who’s a huge bookworm .

Feyre loves to hunt and to paint as well 

So not very much a bookworm unlike Belle 

Also there’s no Rose in this story and no petals falling off the rose if she does not fix the curse 

Also no such thing as a curse either in this book

Tamlin is a fairy like creature with fangs that only appear sometimes not all the time though

He can control his fangs showing or not 

Unlike the beauty and the beast . At the end of the story .

Feyre becomes a fairy like creature . The Same as Tamlin after she dies to get herself alive again. The other high lords of the courts 

That’s the other areas in this world called Pryithan give her their powers 

That’s how she become a fairy like creature near the end of the book aka story 

Just like Tamlin and his assistant Lucien as well 

That’s how this story is different than the beauty and the beast 

But is like the beauty and the beast . Because Feyre gets captured by Tamlin in the beginning of the story just like Belle get captured by the Beast in the Beauty and the beast 

I give it 9 And a half stars because there’s was some I would say steamy make up sessions between Feyre the main character and her capturer Tamlin in some parts . 

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ out of 10 stars 

That are a bit more steamy than other YA books . Also because Feyre is like 20 in this book. So I call this book New Adult . Also the rest of the books in this series as well . But you were find these books in the young adult section of your public library or ya / teen in your public book store though . Even though the characters are in their 20’s because they do drink wine in this series . That is why they are in their 20’s. Teenagers don’t drink Wine . That’s how I know it’s New Adult but not fully adult sort of books either . Still on the cusp between being like a teenager but not fully feel like an adult yet either .

Not a fully a book for adults but for people on their 20’s . Who are still young and trying to finger themselves out like a teenager . But passed the teenager age in this world called earth . Still in self discovery but as a young adult not a teenager 

If you very like fairies , magic, retelling of a famous story and a strong female heroine as a main character  . Also interested in fairy politics as well . 

You will very like this sort of book and the rest of the books in this series as well then
