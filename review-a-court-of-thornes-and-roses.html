    <h1>My A COURT of THORNES and ROSES</h1>
 
    <p>It’s pretty much a beauty and a beast retelling</p>
    <p>Based off the plot </p>
    <p>A human girl gets stuck in a castle with a beast . But not always a beast . Sometimes a handsome high lord . Which is like a prince but lord instead of the word prince .Only sometimes he’s a beast aka a wolf </p>
    <p>Expect there’s no curse not very or enchanted objects in his palace aka castle </p>
    <p>Instead he have an Assistant.</p>
    <p>The beast’s name Is Tamlin.</p>
    <p>The girl aka beauty’s name is Feyre . </p>
    <p>Unlike Belle who’s a huge bookworm .</p>
    <p>Feyre loves to hunt and to paint as well </p>
    <p>So not very much a bookworm unlike Belle </p>
    <p>Also there’s no Rose in this story and no petals falling off the rose if she does not fix the curse </p>
    <p>Also no such thing as a curse either in this book</p>
    <p>Tamlin is a fairy like creature with fangs that only appear sometimes not all the time though</p>
    <p>He can control his fangs showing or not </p>
    <p>Unlike the beauty and the beast . At the end of the story .</p>
    <p>Feyre becomes a fairy like creature . The Same as Tamlin after she dies to get herself alive again. The other high lords of the courts </p>
    <p>That’s the other areas in this world called Pryithan give her their powers </p>
    <p>That’s how she become a fairy like creature near the end of the book aka story </p>
    <p>Just like Tamlin and his assistant Lucien as well </p>
    <p>That’s how this story is different than the beauty and the beast </p>
    <p>But is like the beauty and the beast . Because Feyre gets captured by Tamlin in the beginning of the story just like Belle get captured by the Beast in the Beauty and the beast </p>
    <p>I give it 9 And a half stars because there’s was some I would say steamy make up sessions between Feyre the main character and her capturer Tamlin in some parts . </p>
    <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ out of 10 stars </p>
    <p>That are a bit more steamy than other YA books . Also because Feyre is like 20 in this book. So I call this book New Adult . Also the rest of the books in this series as well . But you were find these books in the young adult section of your public library or ya / teen in your public book store though . Even though the characters are in their 20’s because they do drink wine in this series . That is why they are in their 20’s. Teenagers don’t drink Wine . That’s how I know it’s New Adult but not fully adult sort of books Still on the cusp between being like a teenager but not fully feel like an adult yet either .</p>
    <p>Not a fully a book for adults but for people on their 20’s . Who are still young and trying to finger themselves out like a teenager . But passed the teenager age in this world called earth . Still in self discovery but as a young adult not a teenager </p>
    <p>If you very like fairies , magic, retelling of a famous story and a strong female heroine as a main character  . Also interested in fairy politics as well . </p>
    <p>You will very like this sort of book and the rest of the books in this series as well then </p>
