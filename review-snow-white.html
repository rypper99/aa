    <h1>Snow White Live Action Movie Review</h1>

    <p><br></p>
    <p>I saw it a few days ago . On Last Sunday Evening . With Macie ( Emma&rsquo;s younger sister ).</p>
    <p>It a was very good movie&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t understand the hate for this movie</p>
    <p>What I say Taylor&rsquo;s words &ldquo; Haters gonna hate, hate, hate. I will just shake it off &ldquo;</p>
    <p>The music was very, very good&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I like that they make Snow White a strong female heroine than just a damsel in distress&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I also like they make dopey talk later on in the movie</p>
    <p>It follows the same story as the original but tweak it to make it more mordern</p>
    <p>Like when Snow White wake up from her deep sleep. Saving her kingdom from the evil Queen</p>
    <p>Make the love interest have more personaitly and not a prince. Like a Robin Hood type of character&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I very like that too</p>
    <p>There was some kissing but that&rsquo;s ok</p>
    <p>I give it a 6 out of 10 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars out of 10</p>
    <p>Pretty good movie. But not Frozen or Moana through</p>
    <p>But still a very good movie through&nbsp;</p>
