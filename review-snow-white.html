    <h1>Snow White Live Action Movie Review</h1>

    <p>
I saw it a few days ago . On Last Sunday Evening . With Macie ( Emma’s younger sister ).
It a was very good movie 
I don’t understand the hate for this movie
What I say Taylor’s words “ Haters gonna hate, hate, hate. I will just shake it off “
The music was very, very good 
I like that they make Snow White a strong female heroine than just a damsel in distress 
I also like they make dopey talk later on in the movie
It follows the same story as the original but tweak it to make it more mordern
Like when Snow White wake up from her deep sleep. Saving her kingdom from the evil Queen
Make the love interest have more personaitly and not a prince. Like a Robin Hood type of character 
I very like that too
There was some kissing but that’s ok
I give it a 6 out of 10 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars out of 10
Pretty good movie. But not Frozen or Moana through
But still a very good movie through
