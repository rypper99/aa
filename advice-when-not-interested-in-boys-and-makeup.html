    <h1>When not interested in boys and makeup</h1>

    <p>If Anybody is in Middle School Right Now and is a girl. A few of your friends from elementary school start be interested in the other gender ( boys  ) and wearing makeup .</p>
    <p>But you are not interested in the opposite gender( boys ) in that way  and wearing makeup yourself.</p>
    <p>You do still remember the times you and your female friends say “ oh cooties “ to guys while in elementary school .</p>
    <p>Also you still sleep with a stuffed animal but your friends forgot about their stuffed animals and give them up .</p>
    <p>You are interested in other things not the same things as your friends are now.</p>
    <p>You prefer watching cartoons, stuffed animals and hopscotch to boys and wearing makeup  ?</p>
    <p>If they are real friends. They will understand “ hey I am not interested in boys and makeup unlike you are . Hope that’s ok with you “</p>
    <p>But if they don’t understand how you are different than them. They are not your true friends then </p>
    <p>Find people who still sleep with a stuffed animal at night and love watching cartoons instead of reality tv shows . Who still think boys have cooties just like you </p>
    <p>To be your new friends </p>
    <p>If your friends start peer pressuring you into dating and wearing make up </p>
    <p>Then they are not your real, true friends then</p>
    <p>Find the people that are just like you and won’t pressure you into anything you are uncomfortable with like dating and wearing makeup for a few examples </p>
